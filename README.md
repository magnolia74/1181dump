# 1181dump
This is a dump of code used on the CS-1181 class.

Some of the questions may change in the future, but some remain the same.

DISCLAIMER!! Use the code at your own risk, I would recommend copy my own and turn it in your way.

If any person of the administration i.e. University want to "accuse" me of any "illegal" activity, read this -- I have NO RESPONSIBILITY of this code and anything goes with it. The code is open source and free from ownership. That's why the author of this git remains anonymous. If you expose me of my real-life name under any circumstacnes, again, I have NO RESPOSIBILITIES! Again, I have NO RESPONSIBILITY!

Thanks.
